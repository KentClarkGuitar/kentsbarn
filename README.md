Kent's Barn is a Simon-like memory game that
tests the user's audio memory by playing animal calls.
Starting with a sequence call of 1, the user must click on the animals in the order of the sequence.
The sequence continues until the user fails. 

There is a play clock that begins at 30 seconds and counts down.
The user has the alotted time in order to make a click.
If the timer runs out before the user can click, the game is over.
